	<h1>Good Content Writing</h1>
	<p>Good content writing is similar to baking a cake. The ingredients you put in, or leave out, will determine whether or not your post rises or falls. Are you missing any of the following content writing secrets?</p>
	<h2>Content Writing Secret #1</h2>	
	<p><b>The Headline:</b> Every post has a title.</p>
	<p>The main purpose of the post title is to attract attention and get clicks from interested prospects. If you turn boring post titles into captivating headlines you'll easily get more clicks and visitors.</p>
	<p>So imagine this…</p>
	<p>You create a killer post. It's the mack-daddy of all posts (Yes – it's really good!)</p>
	<p>Then unfortunately you attach some lame headline, hit publish, and send it to search engines and social media sites.</p>
	<p>What Happens?</p>
	<p>Zip-Nadda-Nothing! The text-link fails to capture anyone's attention and therefore slips right through the fingers of your would-be prospects.
	Not because your posts aren't good, because I'm sure they are, but if you can't “get the click,” your writing remains anonymous, and no one wins.</p>
	<p>Here's an in-depth post, and tutorial, on how to write content and find the best headlines. Another great source is Jon Morrows – 52 headline Hacks. Listen to more on the topic of writing great headlines in the headline writing clinic.</p>
	<h2>Content Writing Secret #2</h2>
	<p><b>The Opener:</b> The first sentence has 2 main purposes…</p>
	<p>The first main purpose is to get them reading.</p>
	<p>The second main purpose is to keep them reading.</p>
	<p>What can we do to make the first sentence so compelling, so simple, and so interesting that our readers continue to read?</p>
	<p>Answer: Make it short.</p>
	<p>You can start the first sentence with a short question, or statement.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Losing weight isn't easy</li>
		<li>Have you ever done this?</li>
		<li>It was bound to happen</li>
		<li>Does this make sense?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you keep the first sentence short and easy to read, the reader will be compelled, by their curiosity, to read on.</p>
	<div><h2>Content Writing Secret #3</h2>
		<p>Want more readers? Make it Look Easy.</p>
		<p>Separate large paragraphs into short punchy sentences (one to three sentences max).</p>
		<section><p>Think about it, what's the first thing people do when they land on a post?</p></section>
		<p>They quickly scan the headline, picture, and text, then decide whether or not to jump into the post based on time, interest, and readability.
		Lots of white-space helps the post look easy more inviting and less intimidating to read.</p></div>
		<p>On the other hand long paragraphs and big blocks of text deter readers by making the posts look difficult and time consuming.
